        <H1>4/3/2020 - Code for my Website[CSS].</H1>
        <p class="p1">Below you can see a few segment of my current CSS code for my website, just simple starting css code that adds a background, buttons, grid and some other things, right now the grid is used as my navigation bar. This will soon change as a grid does not quite work well as a navigation bar you would need to spam "auto" many time and change max-width for it often. A lot of things currently are a work in progress, bear[pun] with me as I work out these problems.</p>
