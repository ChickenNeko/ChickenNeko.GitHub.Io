            <H1>Welcome to SnowNeko Website Portfolio</H1>
            <p>Hello, I am SnowNeko and this is my very first attempt at a long life project for learning HTML and practicing web delevopment by making my own portfolio using HTML. Originally I had a portfolio on <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a>, being helped by my teacher at GameGen to create a good looking portfolio that not only is pretty to the eyes but shows off my skills and growth as I continue my path towards becoming a video game delevoper!</p>
